# social-netowrk-api

## Description
* MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. I am tasked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site.and Mongoose Links to an external site.packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## Installations
* this assignment requires you to install all the packages with the npm i command. npm install mongoose is also essential for this assignment as well.
